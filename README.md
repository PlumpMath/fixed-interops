# fixed-interops

These are Steam SDK C# interoperability classes distributed with the SteamWorks SDK. Because SteamWorks is public, anyone can download the interops and use them -- but they're horribly broken and don't compile out of the box, which discourages users of SteamWorks from integrating with C# projects. @Olink is the person who fixed the compiler errors, thank him for everything <3

## How to use

Add to your project; use interops. The API is documented in SteamWorks.
